    - RegExp

    One of the most common tasks is to validate the user's email and password.
    Write two regular expressions, 
      one of which will validate the email for spelling validity 
        (the presence of a @ character, the number of characters before and after, the presence of a domain and allowed characters) 
      and the second that will validate the password according to basic rules 
        (only Latin and numbers, and a special character are allowed " ?,!, @, -, +, = ". Large and small letters must be present, the password is at least 8 characters long)

    IMPORTANT: try to write without looking at ready-made solutions.
