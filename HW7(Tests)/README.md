    1) Choose one of the frameworks for testing (Jest or Jasmine)
    2) Set up an environment for testing (json package + test config)
    3) Choose any that you will cover with tests. You need several methods with different functionality (You can take your code from the previous HW)
    4) Write unit tests that will cover all business cases of using this code.
