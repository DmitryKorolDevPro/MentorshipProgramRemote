  Write two solutions for each problem.
  - in an iterative style (no higher-order functions)
  - applying higher-order functions

  1. we have an array containing the year of birth of some people, 
  and we need to create an array that will contain their age in 2020

  2. we have an array containing objects, the properties of which store 
  information about the name and age of representatives of a certain group of people. 
  We need to create an array, which will contain information only about the adult 
  representatives of this group (those whose age has reached 18 years old)

  3. Let's say we have an array of numbers. We need to calculate the sum of its elements.

  4. Let's say JavaScript doesn't have a standard array method map (). 
  We can easily create such a method on our own, which will be expressed 
  in the development of a higher-order function.

  Suppose we have an array of strings, and we would like to create an array with numbers on its basis, 
  each of which represents the length of a string stored in some element of the original array.



  Task for working with OOP:
    Write an abstract class
    Create two classes using inheritance (not abstract)
    Create instances of these classes

  The implementation and usefulness of ideas should be clearly demonstrated:
  Inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism (as much as possible)

  Implement in two ways. With the help of the ES6 classes and with the help of prototypes.



  Functional programming task:
  Come up with and write an example program that will contain and demonstrate the principle of operation:

    Higher-order functions
    First class functions
    Pure functions
    Function side effect
    Unchanging state
    Shared State
    Closures
    Recursion
    Partial function application
